"""
Subsets (Power Set as binary vectors)

Description:
Generates all subsets (as binary vectors) of size n using recursion.
The idea: for subsets of size n-1, duplicate them by appending a 0 and a 1
to each, obtaining all subsets of size n.

ALGORITHM subsets(n)
Generates all binary subsets of length n
Input: integer n (size of the binary vector)
Output: list of lists with 0/1 representing each subset

- Time complexity:  O(2^n)
